# A-Level-Project
My finished a level project, where I made multiple AI systems for tic tac toe and ultimate tic tac toe, including heuristic minimax AI, machine learning AI and rule based AI.
It's built into a server that can be accessed across a local network and also has basic encryption when sending data (caesar cipher).
